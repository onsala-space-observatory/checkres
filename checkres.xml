    <shortdescription>Task for a quick check of image residuals in Fourier space.</shortdescription>
    <description>
      This task performs the FFT on an image (cube) and overplots the
      baseline UV tracks. This can be useful to locate baselines
      responsible of dynamic range limitations. It is interactive: the
      user can click on any baseline and/or antenna in the plot, and
      the track of that baseline will be highlighted over the FFT of
      the image residuals.

      If you click on the UV plot (i.e., upper left plot) with the
      left (right) mouse button, the first (second) antenna of the
      seelected baseline will be highlighted.
